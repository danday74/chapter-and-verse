* Book numbering

* Options - e.g. English / Hebraic book order - but Hebraic versification is different I think so supporting Hebraic book order without supporting Hebraic versification is weird

* Next / prev for iteration

* Remove functions?

* Allow for other versification differences - e.g. Romans WEB

* Option to determine which differences to allow?

* Add browser unit tests - Currently cv.spec.js makes testing in the browser difficult

* II Samuel, II Kings, etc
